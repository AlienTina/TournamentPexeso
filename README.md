# TournamentPexeso
Pexeso client and server made for hosting tournaments.

## Usage
Currently, all the configuration can only be done through Terminal.
### Server
Just run the executable. Optionally, you can run the executable through the terminal and add your desired port as the first argument. (For example `pexeso-server.exe 1234`)
### Client
Run the executable through the terminal, where the first argument is the ip to the server, and the second argument is your username. (for example `pexeso-client.exe 192.168.1.69:8181 Epic_player_69`)
